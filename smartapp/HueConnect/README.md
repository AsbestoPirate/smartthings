# Hue (ReConnect)

This is my attempt to improve the existing HueConnect smartapp by adding scene handling.

You can now add the scene you want this will create for you a push button to enable scenes. \o/

## How it looks

## How to install

Remove all your existing bulbs / and HueConnect SmartApp.

Then create a new smartapp in IDE from code and also add each devices type you can find under HueDevices folder.

**Note:**
This application will not list the stock scenes (who want then after all).

**TIPS:**
On the hue application when you create a new scene, trigger it once, and also trigger the off button on the left when you click on the scene (where you can also change the luminosity). Then you can add it to smarthtings using the smartApp. This will allow you to turn off the scene from smartthings as well :) (When you manually trigger the Off button on the Hue application this will generate a hidden scene to turn of the current scene). This can be done after you added the scene as well.
